# citibike

Launched in 2013, Citi Bike is the first official public bicycle-sharing system in New York City.
Citi Bike has been a success from the start, its annual subscribers surging past 20,000 in its first
year and amounting to 60,000 trips per day in 2016. Citi Bikeâ€™s considerably popularity has
increased the interest in analyzing the sociodemographic, holiday and weather factors that affect
bicycle-sharing flows and usage. Using publicly available daily and monthly trip data from July
2013 to December 2016, this study takes a regression-based approach in examining the influence
of rider characteristics and meteorological data on bike usage, specifically trip distance per user
and daily trip counts. The findings allow us to identify the demographics of a frequent Citi Bike
rider and segment the potential customers.
